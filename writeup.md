## Reading Comprehension Questions

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

The difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code locally, while GitHub is a hosted platform (issues, PRs, CI, code review) that uses Git under the hood.  

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing and pushing are the two main steps in the Git workflow. Committing is the process of saving your changes to your local repository, while pushing is the process of sending your local changes to the remote repository (GitHub). Commits create small, descriptive checkpoints so you can review or roll back your code safely. Pushing publishes those checkpoints to the remote so others (such as CI/CD pipelines) can download your code and review it/build it.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is a directory that contains your project's files and history. It can contain code, documentation, and other project-related files such as config files, scripts and such. A repo also contains a hidden .git directory with the full history/metadata. Platform features like Issues/PRs live on GitHub, not inside Git.

## Profile Repository Link 

*Note: You should use the profile README rahter then the repository link since it has context that the repository does not, such as my commit graph name and status. The profile repository was included purely for completeness.*

**Profile Link:** https://github.com/Ogyeet10
**Profile README Repository:** https://github.com/Ogyeet10/Ogyeet10

## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

I am most excited to learn about how AI can be used to help with the development of software and help with tasks that are otherwise boring and time-consuming, like boilerplate code or documentation. It seems like AI is the future of software development and I want to be able to use it to my advantage to become more efficient and productive. Like for example, I used CodeRabbit to codereview my PRs for me on my personal projects. Besides that im excited to learn what underlies AI and how it works. 

<sub>*But honestly besides AI I'm excited to learn more about Python sicen I've been a TypeScript dev for a while now and I've been wanting to learn it for a while but havent had a reason to do so since TypeScript dose everything Python can do essentially just with a bit of added complexity.*</sub>
